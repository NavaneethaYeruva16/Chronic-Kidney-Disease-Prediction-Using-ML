# Chronic-Kidney-Disease-Prediction-Using-MACHINE LEARNING
ABSTRACT
Chronic Kidney Disease or CKD is one of the most prevalent disease Which influence
humans on a larger scale and proves to be fatal as it remains dormant unless irreversible
damages have been made to the kidney of an individual. Progression of CKD is related to
variety of great complications,including increased incidence of various disorders, anemia, hyperlipidemia, nerve damage, pregnancy complications and even complete kidney failure. It is critical to have reliable techniques at predicting CKD in its early stages. Machine
learning (ML) techniques are excellent in predicting CKD. This project offers a methodology
for predicting CKD status using clinical data, which incorporates data preprocessing, a
technique for managing missing values, data aggregation, and feature extraction. Millions of people die from this disease every year. Diagnosing CKD is a cumbersome task
as there are no major symptom that can be used as a benchmark to detect the disease. We
have used a Machine learning approach for predicting if a patient has CKD. This project
involves different ML algorithms such as XGB Classifier, Random Forest, Logistic
Regression, Support Vector Machine
